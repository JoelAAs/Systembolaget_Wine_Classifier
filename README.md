# Systembolaget_webcrawl

This R program is able to create a simple database of the red wines at Systembolaget, 
and based on scores given to wines, it will predict scores to other wines based on 
taste keywords, grapes, country and other factors. 

Alla+Artiklar.csv is a CSV version of the "Sortimentsfilen" XML file available as part
of Systembolaget's open API. It is part of Systembolagets intellectual property, as
described on http://www.systembolaget.se/Tjanster/Oppna-APIer (in swedish).
